### 2. Refreshing SQL Knowledge ([Link](https://github.com/KarenJF/DataScience/tree/master/SQL)) 
I've been using SQL on a daily basis to do my health analytic work. But all my SQL is done within SAS EG. I'd like to refresh my knowledge on SQL. So I almost practice SQL online and took some SQL Bootcamps to refresh my knowledge. Most of the online resources are free, such as SQLZOO, Udacity SQL etc. 

1. (02/09/2018) **_The Complete SQL Bootcamp_**
    - I also took a quick SQL Bootcamp on Udemy. Since I've been using SQL daily, this course is no challenge to me. I'm able to finish the course in less than 2 days.
