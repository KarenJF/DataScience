# A Self-Learn Journey to Data Science
(https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links)

This is a place to document on how I learn Data Science myself.

## 1. Learning Python ([link](https://github.com/KarenJF/DataScience/tree/master/Learn_Python))
Since December 2017, I've been using online resources to learn python. 
1. (12/20/2017) **_Udemy Online Course: Complete Python Bootcamp: Go from zero to hero in Python_**
* _Review_: This is my first python course. At the time I took it, it's in python2. But the instructor also provides python3 syntax whenever it's applicable. I know I want to learn python3. So I changed all the assignments in python3 syntax. This is a very comprehensive course from python basic to methods, functions, moduels and packages. I learned a lot in this course. But to master python and be familiar with it, the best way to do so is to practice day-in and day-out.

2. (5/29/2018) **_DataQuest: Python For Beginner_**
* _Review_: This is one of the classes in the DataQuest Data Science Path. I did this mainly to refresh my knowledge in python. It's very intuitive as you will be coding and learning at the same time.

## 2. Refreshing SQL Knowledge  
I've been using SQL on a daily basis to do my health analytic work. But all my SQL is done within SAS EG. I'd like to refresh my knowledge on SQL. So I almost practice SQL online and took some SQL Bootcamps to refresh my knowledge. Most of the online resources are free, such as SQLZOO, Udacity SQL etc. 

1. (02/09/2018) **_The Complete SQL Bootcamp_**
    - I also took a quick SQL Bootcamp on Udemy. Since I've been using SQL daily, this course is no challenge to me. I'm able to finish the course in less than 2 days.
