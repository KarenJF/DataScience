### Scenario: You are contracted by a Westeros software developer with a Health and Wellness app looking to break into the Essos market. Based on the provided data set your objective is to advise the client on the following:

1. Who are the current market leaders in the Health and Wellness category and why are they
successful? HINT: what metrics support your findings?
2. What market segments should your client target? The client is interested in opportunities presented in
targeting based on location, current app usage behaviors, phone brand, and other demographic
information available. HINT: do not limit yourself to counts and histograms.
3. The client is interested in partnering with apps outside the Health and Wellness space to drive cross
promotion. Where are the biggest opportunities? Please create some short bullet points to support the
recommendation in both data science and business contexts.
