## Introduction to Deep Learning with PyTorch

In this notebook, I'm going to talk about PyTorch, a framework for building and training neural networks. PyTorch in a lot of ways behaves like the arrays you love from Numpy. These Numpy arrays, after all, are just tensors. PyTorch takes these tensors and makes it simple to move them to GPUs for the faster processing needed when training neural networks. It also provides a module that automatically calculates gradients (for backpropagation!) and another module specifically for building neural networks. All together, PyTorch ends up being more coherent with Python and the Numpy/Scipy stack compared to TensorFlow and other frameworks.

I combined a series of tutorial to help to get started on how to use PyTorch on Deep Learning. In this series, we are going to use PyTorch to work on some interesting deep learning model.
