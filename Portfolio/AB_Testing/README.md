**Project: Use A/B Testing to test whether we should launch a feature**

**Background:**

**Experiment Overview: Free Trial Screener**

At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses currently have two options on the course overview page: "start free trial" and "access course materials". 
  - If the student clicks "start free trial", they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first. 
  - If the student clicks "access course materials", they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.

In the experiment, we tested a change where if the student clicked "start free trial", they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course. 
  - If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. 
  - If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free. At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead. 

**_Goal_**: With these new feature, will the school increase students net conversion rate and increase student satisfaction? That's given more information and evalute students needs before students sign-up for the course, will we increase the paid service from students once they are ready and sign-up? Also, in the long run, hoping this feature increase students satisfaction. 

Let's do a A/B testing to find out!
