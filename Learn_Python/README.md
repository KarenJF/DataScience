## 1. Learning Python ([link](https://github.com/KarenJF/DataScience/tree/master/Learn_Python))
Since December 2017, I've been using online resources to learn python. 
1. (12/20/2017) **_Udemy Online Course: Complete Python Bootcamp: Go from zero to hero in Python_**
* _Review_: This is my first python course. At the time I took it, it's in python2. But the instructor also provides python3 syntax whenever it's applicable. I know I want to learn python3. So I changed all the assignments in python3 syntax. This is a very comprehensive course from python basic to methods, functions, moduels and packages. I learned a lot in this course. But to master python and be familiar with it, the best way to do so is to practice day-in and day-out.

2. (5/29/2018) **_DataQuest: Python For Beginner_**
* _Review_: This is one of the class in the DataQuest Data Science Path. I did this mainly to refresh my knowledge in python. It's very intuitive as you will be coding and learning at the same time.
